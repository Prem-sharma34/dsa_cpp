Arrays
In programming , we often encounter such situations, where need to
store a collection of data

An array is a collection of items of same data types stored at contiguous 
memory locations.

Types:

1D array
2D array
Multi-Dimensional array


1D Arrays:
    . store elements
    . accessed using an index

    |1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5|
Start from index = 0
If 1 --> 0 
Then nth --> n-1


Declaration:
    
    int arr[5] = {1,3,4,8,8};

This statment tell that, create a array of size 5 which is called arr 
and store int type values

Updating a specific element:

arr[2] = 10;

Then the new array will be: {1, 3,10,8,8}



Traversal:
It just looping over all the value of the array

void printArray(int * arr, int n)
{
    int i;
    cout<<"Array: ";
    for(i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
}
